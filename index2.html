            <h3>Dear Likitha,</h3>
            <p>I don‚Äôt write letters which convey my feelings to a person but this is an exception so I am writing this additional letter to tell this.. I would have just loved to tell all this to you by myself in a slower pace but I don‚Äôt have much time to do so.This is my last week coming to the gym in the evenings as I have to attend to social service which will take up my entire daytime. </p>
	
            <p>I hope this letter is not going to disturb the budding bond that we share now. </p>

            <p>The first time I saw to you, I knew you were someone special..</p>
	
            <p>It‚Äôs been five whole years since I liked a girl after my breakup in 11th. I will be totally honest with you, that I had many attractions in this time but never wanted to speak to anyone until I saw you. The first day I saw you in the gym sitting there cycling, I was just lost in your charm. The tingling urge to talk to you was so strong but I dared not to since you were with your uncle. The next few days I was just assuming that you too would be like any other attraction and didn‚Äôt try to talk but the feeling never faded and just grew stronger and stronger. The first time I could speak to you, was almost like a dream come true for meüòÖ</p>

            <p>Every time I see you, I get a stupid grin on my face which I am not so proud of.üòÖ</p>
	
            <p>Coming to the confession that I want to make, I am attracted to you emotionally and physically‚Ä¶ Everyday I look forward to those 15 or 20 minutes of time where we talk to each other. It makes me feel happy and joyful. I know I must be very annoying asking you what time you come everyday but it was just to be able to talk to you. I know that whatever I feel for you is not just any crush or attraction but something more. It could be love but I am not entirely sure what qualifies to be love and what does not. So I do not want to name this as love and I came up with a new name called ‚ÄúTalk-ship‚Äù since we just talküò¨</p>

            <p>Every night before I go to bed I just replay the entire episode of us talking that day and plan for what to talk for the next day even though whatever I planned was never spoken a single timeüòÇ. Most of the times you are on my conscious just making me think twice before I make any choices. I would like to know each and every tiny detail about you and also want to share everything about myself too. All I want is to be the closest person with whom you can feel protected, confident and mostly just yourself.</p>

            <p>Okay coming to being practical which is the way you like things to be,‚Ä¶. yes I may not be as cool as you are  or as outgoing as you are but I am quite serious about what I feel towards you. I know you might say it is just a crush or something and it will fade, but it is not going anywhere. I feel this feeling is here to stay for a very long time(years) even if I don‚Äôt get to see you. Every day I miss you and the days that I don‚Äôt get to talk to you are the worst.</p>

            <p>I understand that you may not share any of the feelings that I have towards you. It‚Äôs the worst feeling to even think about but I know it is possible. In case you are in this state, I don‚Äôt know what to say or how to convince you which I truly want to do‚Ä¶</p>

            <p>I am just leaving my number with you which is 6366578303, in case you want to call or message feel free to do. If you feel like contacting me but your ego says why text or call first, please just do text me this once and I will make it up to you for sure‚Ä¶</p>

            <p>In case you don‚Äôt want to call or message, you can send a message from the message box at the bottom of this page. I will not receive any details from you (and please don‚Äôt share this link with anyone since in case they send any message , I might assume that it is from you)</p>

            <p>Please either message to my number or respond on this page. You can send multiple responses from here too. I really look forward to your reply</p>

            <p>I respect you a great amount and whatever you decide my respect towards you will never change‚Ä¶.. Wish I can be someone close to you‚Ä¶</p>
	
            <p>Every single day I wish we had met someplace else where it was quite, relaxing ,emotionally intimate and where we would have got much more time.</p>

            <p>P.S: I wrote this letter in just 1 hour before coming to the gym assuming that I may not be able to see you in near future again.. So if it shows that I am too demanding or outright please don‚Äôt think ill about me.</p>

            <p>P.S: You are my gym motivationüòá</p>

			<p>Yours,</p>
